=====
-use logger instead of print, productivity code should contain no prints (with very few exceptions)
-use logger.error and logger.crit only for messages which should be reported as bug.

Services and plugins should work independend of their starting order:
-services should not depend on other services in __init__. 
They may depend on other services beeing instanced (__init__) but not started (startService) in their
startService routine.
-plugins may depend on other plugins, but not in __init__.
