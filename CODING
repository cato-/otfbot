General guidelines
------------------
- Read, understand and apply PEP8 (check with pep8.py)
- Write docstrings
- Use logger instead of print, productivity code should contain
  no prints (with very few exceptions)
- Use logger.error and logger.crit only for messages which should
  be reported as bug.
- Be always aware of blocking code. Network access should be handled with
  twisted's methods, file system access should be done in a thread

Current Caveats
---------------
Services and plugins should work independently of their starting order

- Services should not depend on other services in the constructor. They may
  depend on other services being instanced (__init__) but not started
  (startService) in their startService method.
- Plugins may depend on other Plugins, but not in their constructor
