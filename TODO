core:
* add a way to cleanly stop the bot from system (twisted has something in a reactor)
* maybe add channel-name to log-messages
* priorities of callbacks for modules (module with the highest priority will get the callback first)
* return value for chatmod callbacks, which can be NO_FURTHER_PROCESSING or maybe MSG_CHANGED(newmsg) or something like this.
** In this case, logMod should get the highest priorty for right logging, and some mod could alter the message, and pass it to the kiMod
* get modechars and channeltypes from servergreeting
* ability not to *load* modules for certain networks
* don't use global variables in Bot (classes, logging, modechars, ..)
* put the stuff, which is now plain in otfbot.py in a class
* limit the commands processed (maybe put some users temporarily on ignore) and limit the lines sent per minute
modules:
* extent modules-api
* http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs
logMod:
* make logfilerotation working (should work, if needed more exactly use scheduler)
rdfMod:
* use real parser(?)
kiMod:
* limit brainsize (maybe requires hacking the megahalpython-binding)
