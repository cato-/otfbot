core:
* add a way to cleanly stop the bot from system (twisted has something in a reactor)
* maybe add channel-name to log-messages
* priorities of callbacks for modules (module with the highest priority will get the callback first)
* return value for chatmod callbacks, which can be NO_FURTHER_PROCESSING or maybe MSG_CHANGED(newmsg) or something like this.
** In this case, logMod should get the highest priorty for right logging, and some mod could alter the message, and pass it to the kiMod
* get modechars and channeltypes from servergreeting
* ability not to *load* modules for certain networks
* don't use global variables in Bot (classes, logging, modechars, ..)
** own class-file for bot, factory (not possible at the moment because of too much global vars)
* limit the commands processed (maybe put some users temporarily on ignore) and limit the lines sent per minute
modules:
* extent modules-api
* http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs
logMod:
* make logfilerotation working (should work, if needed more exactly use scheduler)
kiMod:
* limit brainsize (maybe requires hacking the megahalpython-binding)
* I18N
* karmaMod with one karmafile per channel
** open in join
** close in leave
** closeall in disconnect
** dict with channel -> karma-structure
** dict with channel -> filename to write on leave
** allow shared karma (write only once if filename is the same, two pointers to one structure in channel->karma dict)
* authMod should use network information for whitelist(!)
