core:
* maybe add channel-name to log-messages
* priorities of callbacks for modules (module with the highest priority will get the callback first)
* return value for chatmod callbacks, which can be NO_FURTHER_PROCESSING or maybe MSG_CHANGED(newmsg) or something like this.
** In this case, logMod should get the highest priorty for right logging, and some mod could alter the message, and pass it to the kiMod
* get modechars and channeltypes from servergreeting
* ability not to *load* modules for certain networks
* limit the commands processed (maybe put some users temporarily on ignore) and limit the lines sent per minute
config:
* remove xml-stuff
* make it editable via control
* change all settingnames with a "." in it
modules:
* extent modules-api
* let modules register their commands
* http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs
* load/unload/reload single modules while the bot is running
logMod:
* make logfilerotation working (should work, if needed more exactly use scheduler)
kiMod:
* limit brainsize (maybe requires hacking the megahalpython-binding)
* I18N
karmaMod:
* one karmafile per channel
** open in join
** close in leave
** closeall in disconnect
** dict with channel -> karma-structure
** dict with channel -> filename to write on leave
** allow shared karma (write only once if filename is the same, two pointers to one structure in channel->karma dict)
authMod:
* authMod should use network information for whitelist(!)
* bitmask for certain permissions
* add password-auth (userdb, may be global)
rdfMod:
* check if rdfMod with dynamic Factor works as intended! (0.3 - 5.0 seems to be stuck at 0.3)
