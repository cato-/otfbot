core:
* maybe add channel-name to log-messages
* priorities of callbacks for modules (module with the highest priority will get the callback first)
* return value for chatmod callbacks, which can be NO_FURTHER_PROCESSING or maybe MSG_CHANGED(newmsg) or something like this.
** In this case, logMod should get the highest priorty for right logging, and some mod could alter the message, and pass it to the kiMod
* get modechars and channeltypes from servergreeting
* ability not to *load* modules for certain networks
* limit the commands processed (maybe put some users temporarily on ignore) and limit the lines sent per minute
modules:
* extent modules-api
* let modules register their commands(?)
* http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs
* load/unload single modules while the bot is running
kiMod:
* limit brainsize (maybe requires hacking the megahalpython-binding)
* I18N
authMod:
* authMod should use network information for whitelist(!)
* bitmask for certain permissions
* add password-auth (userdb, may be global)
* replace all noncritical error-loggers with warning-loggers (see CODING)
feedMod:
* check if feedMod with dynamic Factor works as intended! (0.3 - 5.0 seems to be stuck at 0.3)
