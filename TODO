core:
* add a way to cleanly stop the bot from system (SIGTERM-handling, module "signal)
* maybe add channel-name to log-messages
modules:
* move modules into subdir (eg /module/kiMod.py)
* move data of modules in a subdir of the modules-dir (eg /module/kiMod/megahal1.brn)
* extent modules-api
logMod:
* make logfilerotation working
rdfMod:
* use real parser(?)
* decrease the interval between two hits, if a change was found, increase it, if nothing was changed.
* load the Feeds in a central place, so the Feed only needs to be loaded once f√ºr two(or more) channels
