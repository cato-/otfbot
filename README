ABOUT

OtfBot is a modular IRC-Bot written around the Twisted-Framework. It aims to
be a friendly and handy Service-Bot.

REQUIREMENTS

To run OtfBot you need at least version 2.4 of the Twisted-Framework and the
yaml-bindings for python. If you want to connect via SSL to IRC-Servers you 
also need the pyopenssl-package, if you want to use the feedMod, you need
the feedparser-package. 

The following packages should satisfy this on Debian and Ubuntu:
 * python-twisted
 * python-yaml (not in etch, a package can be found on our ftp)
 * python-pyopenssl
 * python-feedparser
