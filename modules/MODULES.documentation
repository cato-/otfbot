How to write a module

* inherit from chatMod.py
* write a method named "default_settings" which returnes a hash of the default
  settings

Ceveats:
* self.network and self.nickname are available from connectionMade
* the global variable "datadir" says where to store the data. If not 
  using loadList or loadProperties you have to care yourself about 
  creating it.
